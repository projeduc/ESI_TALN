	abstract="Numerous approaches for identifying important content for automatic text summarization have been developed to date. Topic representation approaches first derive an intermediate representation of the text that captures the topics discussed in the input. Based on these representations of topics, sentences in the input document are scored for importance. In contrast, in indicator representation approaches, the text is represented by a diverse set of possible indicators of importance which do not aim at discovering topicality. These indicators are combined, very often using machine learning techniques, to score the importance of each sentence. Finally, a summary is produced by selecting sentences in a greedy approach, choosing the sentences that will go in the summary one by one, or globally optimizing the selection, choosing the best set of sentences to form a summary. In this chapter we give a broad overview of existing approaches based on these distinctions, with particular attention on how representation, sentence scoring or summary selection strategies alter the overall performance of the summarizer. We also point out some of the peculiarities of the task of summarization which have posed challenges to machine learning approaches for the problem, and some of the suggested solutions.",

	abstract="Machine translation is an important technology socio-politically, commercially and scientifically, despite many misconceptions about its success or lack of it over the decades. The emergence of the Internet as one of the main media of modern communication has turned translation into a bridge that connects speakers of different languages. The endless traffic of communication between different language groups requires translation, but when instant translations are needed, human translators are not able to supply them fast enough. A highly skilled profession like translation using human translators is expensive and also slow, especially when a large number of languages and subject fields are involved. In order to meet the growing translation demand, machine translation systems are seen as a cost-effective alternative to human translators in a variety of situations. Ever since the first system was built, machine translation has been presenting scientific challenges (see also Nirenburg 1996). It became the testing ground for many experiments and applications for natural-language processing, artificial intelligence and even linguistics (Arnold etal. 1994: 4--5).",

Our approach combines a search component based on bigram hashing and TF-IDF matching with a multi-layer recurrent neural network model trained to detect answers in Wikipedia paragraphs. Our experiments on multiple existing QA datasets indicate that (1) both modules are highly competitive with respect to existing counterparts and (2) multitask learning using distant supervision on their combination is an effective complete system on this challenging task.",

Dialog state tracking is crucial to the success of a dialog system, yet until recently there were no common resources, hampering progress. The Dialog State Tracking Challenge series of 3 tasks introduced the first shared testbed and evaluation metrics for dialog state tracking, and has underpinned three key advances in dialog state tracking: the move from generative to discriminative models; the adoption of discriminative sequential techniques; and the incorporation of the speech recognition results directly into the dialog state tracker. This paper reviews this research area, covering both the challenge tasks themselves and summarizing the work they have enabled.},

A prototype HIS system for the tourist information domain is evaluated and compared with a baseline MDP system using both user simulations and a live user trial.

Many recently proposed algorithms' enhancements and various SA applications are investigated and presented briefly in this survey. These articles are categorized according to their contributions in the various SA techniques. The related fields to SA (transfer learning, emotion detection, and building resources) that attracted researchers recently are discussed. The main target of this survey is to give nearly full image of SA techniques and the related fields with brief details. The main contributions of this paper include the sophisticated categorizations of a large number of recent articles and the illustration of the recent trend of research in the sentiment analysis and its related areas.}

	abstract = {Sentiments or opinions from social media provide the most up-to-date and inclusive information, due to the proliferation of social media and the low barrier for posting the message. Despite the growing importance of sentiment analysis, this area lacks a concise and systematic arrangement of prior efforts. It is essential to: (1) analyze its progress over the years, (2) provide an overview of the main advances achieved so far, and (3) outline remaining limitations. Several essential aspects, therefore, are addressed within the scope of this survey. On the one hand, this paper focuses on presenting typical methods from three different perspectives (task-oriented, granularity-oriented, methodology-oriented) in the area of sentiment analysis. Specifically, a large quantity of techniques and methods are categorized and compared. On the other hand, different types of data and advanced tools for research are introduced, as well as their limitations. On the basis of these materials, the essential prospects lying ahead for sentiment analysis are identified and discussed.}

	abstract="There has been a significant increase in the volume of Arabic dialect messages on social networks, providing a rich source for opinion mining research. Most research works done on Arabic dialect focus on messages written in Arabic script, with very limited scope on Latin script. In this paper, we are interested in the classification of social networks messages retrieved from Twitter, Facebook and YouTube written in Algerian dialect in Latin script into positive or negative classes using existing opinion mining approaches (lexical-based, machine learning, and hybrid). Also, we apply a regrouping process in the preprocessing step to overcome the issues related to the Algerian dialect such as the orthographic varieties to express the same word. Furthermore, we focus on the hybrid approach which consists in automatically annotating the training corpus with the lexical-based approach and then use the machine learning approach on this corpus for creating the classification model. This approach allows classifying the messages into positive or negative classes, without having to annotate manually a training corpus.",

	abstract = "Arabizi is a form of writing Arabic text which relies on Latin letters, numerals and punctuation rather than Arabic letters. In the literature, the difficulties associated with Arabizi sentiment analysis have been underestimated, principally due to the complexity of Arabizi. In this paper, we present an approach to automatically classify sentiments of Arabizi messages into positives or negatives. In the proposed approach, Arabizi messages are first transliterated into Arabic. Afterwards, we automatically classify the sentiment of the transliterated corpus using an automatically annotated corpus. For corpus validation, shallow machine learning algorithms such as Support Vectors Machine (SVM) and Naive Bays (NB) are used. Simulations results demonstrate the outperformance of NB algorithm over all others. The highest achieved F1-score is up to 78{\%} and 76{\%} for manually and automatically transliterated dataset respectively. Ongoing work is aimed at improving the transliterator module and annotated sentiment dataset.",
